# AP-SPH_ColSim

This is a C++ physics simulation between two stress balls. 
This simulation verifies the Law of the Conservtion of Mechanical Energy and the Law of the Conservation of Linear Momentum.

A cubic regression was performed to determine the force function.

The simulation yields an error 10^-5 times less than the original input dimensions!

TODO: add screenshots.

The source code is omitted to prevent current physics students from seeing it.
